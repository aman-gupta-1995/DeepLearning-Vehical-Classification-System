# Deep-Learning Vehicle Classification


This project is a proof of concept (POC) solution where deep learning techniques are applied to vehicle recognition tasks, this is particularly important task in the area of traffic control and management, for example, companies operating road tolls to detect fraud actions since different fees are applied with regards to vehicle types. Images used to train neural nets are obtained from the [Imagenet](http://image-net.org/) dataset, which publicly distributes images URLs for hundreds of categories. Since the whole experiment is performed on a personal computer with limited computational resources, POC scope is also limited to the simple classification of two different kinds of vehicles: Trailer Trucks versus Sports Cars. Main POC's goal is to determine the maximum accuracy (percent of times model was correct on its predictions) different neural nets with basic architectures can reach using a limited set of images (less than 700) for training.
