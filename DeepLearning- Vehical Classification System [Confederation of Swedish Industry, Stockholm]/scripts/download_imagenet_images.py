This script is intended to download pictures from Imagenet (http://image-net.org/) 
based on the synset by HTTP request as here described: 

        http://image-net.org/download-imageurls
        
This project focus on the flowers classification (http://image-net.org/explore?wnid=n11669921), 
corresponding "WordNet ID" (wnid) of a synset of the different flowers families
are stored in local file: 

        'flowers_synsets.txt' 
        
The different wnid included in such files are used to download pictures for each of the flower families:
